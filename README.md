## Looking under the surface of rustc, _at a safe distance_.

_Aquascope_{: .small} is a tool that generates interactive visualizations from Rust programs. These visualizations aim to help learners intuit correct semantics for the borrow checker and the difference between safe and unsafe programs. Aquascope is distributed as an [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) preprocessor or you can try it out [in the browser](https://gavinleroy.com/aquascope).

<!-- Borrow check information is reformulated in terms of _permissions_, a new pedagogy of ownership to provide learners with a notional machine for this kind of static analysis. Example visualizations and this new pedagogy are demonstrated in the [Rust Book Experiment](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/). -->

> :warning: Aquascope is experimental and under active development!

**TODO** insert a gif demonstrating visualizations

## Installation

### From crates.io

```sh
cargo install mdbook-aquascope
```

### From source

You will first need Cargo and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed, then you can run:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cognitive-engineering-lab/aquascope.git
npm install -g graco
cargo make init-bindings
cd frontend && graco prepare
cargo miri setup
cargo install --path crates/mdbook-aquascope
```

## Usage

### Available Visualizations

Currently, Aquascope supports three types of visualizations:

- _Permission boundaries_: Aquascope will determine the permission expected for a path usage and display this along with the actual permissions on the path. Unsatisfied permissions provide additional information on hover to help explain the discrepancy.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>
<pre>
<code style="display: block; padding: 20px;">
```aquascope,boundaries
fn main() {
    let mut x = 1;
    let y = &mut x;
    println!("{} = {}", x, *y);
}
```
</code>
</pre>
        </td>
        <td>
        TODO: insert image
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

- _Permission steps_: tracking how permissions change throughout a program is difficult, especially when factors such as [liveness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live-variable_analysis) influence the static analysis. Aquascope will insert _steps_ that show how and _why_ permissions change.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>
<code>
```aquascope,stepper
fn main() {
    let mut x = 1;
    let y = &mut x;
    println!("{} = {}", x, *y);
}
```
</code>
        </td>
        <td>
        TODO: insert image
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

- _Runtime execution_: program state visualization is a well-known tool that visualizes the runtime execution of a program. With Aquascope, you can specify which states of a program you'd like to show, and even run programs that don't pass the borrow checker!

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>
<code>
```aquascope,interpreter,concreteTypes=true
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("Hello");
    let s3 = add_suffix(s1);
    println!("{s3}");
}
fn add_suffix(mut s2: String) -> String {
    s2.push_str(" world");
    s2
}
```
</code>
        </td>
        <td>
        TODO: insert image
        </td>
    </tr>

</table>

### Aquascope Annotations

Aquascope provides a set of annotations for each visualization to allow for simple customization. Similar to `mdBook`

#### Stepper Annotations

Visualizing permission steps can be quite intrusive but oftentimes you may want to just focus on a handful of lines, or even specific paths. This can be achieved by providing a _step annotation_ at the end of a line. For example, the annotation `` `(focus,paths:x)` `` indicates that this line should be focused (shown by default) and all paths except `x` are hidden.
These annotations are line specific. Note, that if no lines are specified to be focused then _all_ lines are focused by default, and a similar rule applies per-line for paths.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>
<code>
```aquascope,stepper
fn main() {
    let mut x = 1;
    let y = &mut x; `(focus,paths:x)`
    println!("{} = {}", x, *y);
}
```
</code>
        </td>
        <td>
        TODO: insert image
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
