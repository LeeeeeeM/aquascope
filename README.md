# Aquascope

This README will remain unhelpful until Aquascope is in a semi-decent state.

For current information about what is getting worked on, design decisions, and other project related information, see the `org/` directory. In particular, see the [aquauscope.org](/org/aquascope.org) file which is a good starting place.
