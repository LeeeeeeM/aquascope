[![tests](https://github.com/cognitive-engineering-lab/aquascope/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cognitive-engineering-lab/aquascope/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Aquascope is a tool that generates visualizations aiming to further program understanding. It's distributed as a editor embedable into [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) or you can try it out [in the browser](https://gavinleroy.com/aquascope).

Borrow check information is reformulated in terms of _permissions_, a new pedagogy of ownership to provide learners with a notional machine for this kind of static analysis. Example visualizations and this new pedagogy is demonstrated in the [Rust Book Experiment](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/).

> :warning: Aquascope is experimental and under active development!
