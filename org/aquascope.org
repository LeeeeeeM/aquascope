* What is Aquascope and its Goals
A good way to get some cursory information about the Aquascope project is to
read the [[file:proposal-praktische-arbeit.org][initial proposal]]. This uses some different language, and remained
vague, but it does contain some good objectives.
By definition, the /Praktische Arbeit/ credits at ETH have two sets of --
potentially overlapping -- core goals. These fall into two categories: learning
goals, and contribution goals.

** Visualization Set
The set of visualizations that Aquascope will target is currently in the
brainstorming phase. The visualization ideas listed below are not set in stone.
A good resource on what things are difficult for newcomers to the language is
[[https://songlh.github.io/paper/survey.pdf][this reserach paper]].

*** Using a variable at a higher-than-allowed mutatibility.
The typing relationships for mutability are ~immutable :> mut :> owned~ and
helpful visualization may be to show users when they're attempting to use a
higher mutability level than they currently have. For me, something like
src_rust{let v: Vec<u8> = Vec::default(); v.push(0u8);} falls into this
category, where the ~push~ method requires a ~&mut self~ but only a ~&self~ is
achievable.
A (/possibly few/) concern(s) I have with this visualization:
- How can a visual representation be more helpful than the compiler message?
- Other than a declaration point and usage point, is there anything else
  important to include in a visualization?

*** Using a value after its lifetime has expired.
This is what I would categorize as a /simple/ lifetime mistake. Even though it's
"simple", that doesn't mean it isn't hard for those starting with Rust. A lot of
the popular StackOverflow questions regarding dangling pointers,

** Learning Goals
The learning goals is a set of goals which should contribute to my education and
make me more rounded as a developer. I see this project as having two
overarching themes.
- /Compilers & Systems/: my degree focus, titled: /Safe and Reliable Systems/, aims
  to teach students how to build up a large-scale system in a reliable,
  well-engineered, manner. Many of the core courses have a focus on low level
  systems programming, and interacting with a compiler also falls into this
  category. The Aquascope project will give me more of a reality check when it
  comes to working with compilers. Until now, courses have a focus on student
  languages which tend to be greatly oversimplified and working with a
  production-ready compiler gets left as a learning exercise. In order to build
  a successful product at the end of this project, I will need to interact with
  the ~rustc~ compiler, utilizing static information it provides, and potentially,
  doing my own set of analyses.

- /Education/: outside of my studies I have a personal interest in how people
  learn. I feel fortunate that, until now, my studies have gone well but I know
  that in Computer Science education many people can get lost in the lurch. This
  can be due to lots of things, but often it comes down to how professors teach
  and the learning material available. The programming language [[https://www.rust-lang.org/][Rust]], known for
  its steep learning curve, is a good focus because there is lots of room for
  improvement. Because education is a core goal of the project (discussed
  below), I hope to develop a richer understanding of how people learn and how I
  can tune my own teaching (present and future) to be more effective.

** Contribution Goals
Outside of personal learning goals the project deliverable should provide some
benefit to its target audience. In this case, the target audience is developers
learning or using Rust, as well as education in general. As stated in [[file:proposal-praktische-arbeit.org::Outcome Goal][the initial proposal]].
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
My goals for this project is to leverage static information in order to give the
user a set of visualizations that will simplify understanding errors, and ultimately, facilitate learning. Specifically, such a visualization should /make errors obvious to learners/. Visualizations should require minimal knowledge in order to understand them; one could imagine a version of the Rust Book which includes such visualizations alongside code snippets to reinforce the learning of difficult concepts.
#+END_QUOTE
I'm obviously biased, but I think this is well-stated. These visualizations
should target specific, common problems people have when learning Rust, and
most importantly, are uncluttered and easy to read. This is why there should be
a /set/ of visualizations. Previous projects attempt to provide the users with
static information, which ultimately  douse them in a heavy firehose stream of
complex glyphs and arrows. I want a user to quickly understand why they are
getting a particular compiler error.

If making such easy tools were as simple as stating them as above, why do we
have such complex tools to begin with? I concede that making a user-friendly
tool as described above is much easier said than done. Textbooks often contain
example programs that demonstrate common surface-level issues, but with a few
simple tweaks become a much deeper, harder to understand problem. Rust is no
exception. The language is full of prickly syntax and it's easy to program
oneself into a semantic corner with no escape hatch. Discerning between
/textbook style error/ and /deep semantic error/ is not always trivial, and there is
no hard line that separates the two. The following section [[*Planning and
Discussion]] will attempt to address these ambiguities.

* Planning and Discussion
**** TODO finish reading the StackOverflow questions and categorizing them.
My starting place for understanding where people lack knowledge in Rust is [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/14tRKe-__8CFwfE8yQisCEk_nETBojri5K5aaAd4hP4I/edit#heading=h.h54jfz2x2m50][this
collection of StackOverflow questions]]. These are questions tagged with "rust"
and sorted by frequency. I will link to the topics here and discuss them
briefly, then I will use my own categorization to understand which tasks I want
to target for visualization. They first are ordered and discussed as they are
listed in the aforementioned document, and then analyzed for how this project
wants to categorize them together.

One trend I see emerging is the necessity to understand /a little/ of what's going
on at the memory level. Take for example a question about returning a reference
to a local variable.
#+begin_src rust
// NOTE even including a lifetime &'a String doesn't help.
fn foo() -> & String {
    & String::new()
}
#+end_src
This would be an error, because as soon as the function returns, that memory
could be used by someone else. Confusion can arise however when comparing the
previous to the following.
#+begin_src rust
fn foo() -> & 'static i32 {
    & 42
}
fn bar() -> & 'static [i32] {
    & [1, 2, 3]
}
#+end_src
This *will* compile. The reason behind this is that the literal values got
interned and have a static lifetime.
In short where each respective value lives is important and can affect how the
code compiles. I wonder if allowing users of Aquascope to view static or
interned values is useful.

** Ownership
*** [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32300132/why-cant-i-store-a-value-and-a-reference-to-that-value-in-the-same-struct][+]] Why can't I store a value and a reference to that value in the same struct?
As pointed out in the answers, the misunderstanding demonstrated is what a
lifetime actually represents. This is how long a value is valid /at a specific
location/. If that value gets moved into a different context, the lifetime changes.
#+BEGIN_SRC rust
struct Parent {
    count: u32,
}

struct Child<'a> {
    parent: &'a Parent,
}

struct Combined<'a> {
    parent: Parent,
    child: Child<'a>,
}

impl<'a> Combined<'a> {
    fn new() -> Self {
        /*  -- */ /* 0x00 */ let parent = Parent { count: 42 };
        /*  |        ^^^^ value of child points to memory addr */
        /*  |  */ let child = Child { parent: &parent };
        /*  |  */ /*         vvvvvv -- moved to new address */
        /*  -- */ Combined { parent, child }
    }
}
#+END_SRC
In theory, if the value of src_rust{child} moved with the parent, then this code
wouldn't result in a dangling pointer.

** Dangling Pointers
*** [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/14tRKe-__8CFwfE8yQisCEk_nETBojri5K5aaAd4hP4I/edit#][+]] Is there a way to return a reference to a variable created inside a function?
Again I would classify this as a misconception of lifetimes. Here, the OP is
wondering why a reference to a locally created variable can not be returned.
Specifically, the lifetime is tied to the stack address within the current
function frame.

*** Lifetime & Polonius interactions
**** Polonius and his Sacred Facts
The borrow check information ~rustc~ gives you is in the form of Datalog facts.
There is a set of so-called [[https://docs.rs/polonius-engine/0.13.0/polonius_engine/struct.AllFacts.html][input facts]] and the dual [[https://docs.rs/polonius-engine/0.13.0/polonius_engine/struct.Output.html#structfield.dump_enabled][output facts]]. The output
facts contains information about errors and such, but for the time being, let's
ignore that. I would like to focus on the successful case; what information can
we learn from the *input facts* and how can a visualization give deeper meaning to
a program. An explanation of the input facts, found [[https://rust-lang.github.io/polonius/rules/relations.html][at this poorly
marketed mdoc]], is where I will start. A brief summary and personal thoughts
are provided below.

**** A Bit of Backstory
A small splash of extra information that provides context to the rules. The
rules run on so-called /fact types/. Defined as follows are the ~RustcFacts~. These
are the Atoms of the borrow checker and a rough description of them is found at
the following [[https://rust-lang.github.io/polonius/rules/atoms.html][MDoc link]].

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
impl polonius_engine::FactTypes for RustcFacts {
    type Origin = RegionVid;
    type Loan = BorrowIndex;
    type Point = LocationIndex;
    type Variable = Local;
    type Path = MovePathIndex;
}
#+END_SRC

- A ~Variable~ represents user variables from the /source code/ -- as well as parameters. Thus, if the user clickable actions for lifetimes are variables, then this is a good place to start.

- ~Path~ s are not bijective. That is, all MIR /places/ map to a Path, but the
opposite is not true. Roughly speaking, a path is a path through memory to a
memory location. E.g. ~arr[]~ or ~tup.0~.

<<describing points>>
- For each statement in the MIR, there are *two* associated ~Nodes~ s, the start node
which represents before the statement $S$ has  started executing, and the "mid
node" which represents were $S$ has /taken effect/. XXX the last statement I
haven't fully understood so let's revisit that later [ ] TODO. Nonetheless,
nodes are related by the ~cfg_edge~ fact, more on this below.

- A ~Loan~ represents some borrow that occurs in the source. Each loan has an
associated path that was borrowed along with a mutability. So, in our example,
there would be a single loan, for the ~&x.1~ expression.

- An ~Origin~ is what it typically called in Rust a lifetime. In Polonius, an origin
refers to the set of loans from which a reference may have been created.

**** On to the Juicy Facts
- src_rust{pub cfg_edge: Vec<(T::Point, T::Point)>}
  The first, and most trivial, is the relation that records connected CFG
  points. For each [[https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/struct.Statement.html][MIR statement]] location, two points are generated: the /start/
  and the /mid/. See the above description regarding ~Node~ s [[describing points]].

- src_rust{pub loan_issued_at: Vec<(T::Origin, T::Loan, T::Point)>}
  ~(o: Origin, l: Loan, p: Point)~ The loan ~l~ was issued at point ~p~ creating a
  reference with the origin ~o~. The documentation has a good example of this
  which I will copy here.
  #+begin_src rust
#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
let mut a = 0;
let r = &mut a; // this creates the loan L0
//      ^ let's call this 'a
}
  #+end_src
  There will be a ~loan_issued_at~ fact linking the loan ~L0~ to the origin ~'a~.

- src_rust{pub placeholder: Vec<(T::Origin, T::Loan)>}
  States that the origin is currently a placeholder, with its associated
  placeholder loan. The placeholder represent the scenario of having a function
  who does not know about the loans and thus cannot make assumptions about origins.
- src_rust{pub universal_region: Vec<T::Origin>}
  *Deprecated* : achieves the same thing as ~placeholder~ but does not have an
  associated loan.

- src_rust{pub loan_killed_at: Vec<(T::Loan, T::Point)>}
  A prefix of the path borrowed in ~loan~ is overwritten at ~point~. After this
  point, mutations to the borrowed path no longer invalidate the loan.

- src_rust{pub subset_base: Vec<(T::Origin, T::Origin, T::Point)>}
  ~(o1 origin, o2 origin, p point)~ states that origin ~o1~ outlives origin ~o2~
  at point ~p~. This is denoted in Rust syntax as ~'a: 'b~ where ~'a~ outlives
  lifetime ~'b~.
  NOTE: viewing origins as /sets of loans/ would say that ~o1 <: o2~ meaning that
  all loans of ~o1~ flow into ~o2~. Meaning that ~o1~ is a subset of ~o2~.
  NOTE: this fact is *not* transitive and formes the base of the transitive
  closure computation (hence the prefix ~_base~).

- src_rust{pub loan_invalidated_at: Vec<(T::Point, T::Loan)>}
  At the given ~point~ the ~loan~ has been invalidated by some action. A fact about
  any live loan would indicate an error.

- src_rust{pub known_placeholder_subset: Vec<(T::Origin, T::Origin)>}
  Stores /known/ relationships about placeholder origins. An example would be
  a function with explicitly annotated lifetimes, and those lifetimes contain --
  explicitly or implicitly -- lifetime relationships.

  For the remainder of the facts refer yourself to the current implementation of
  ~facts.rs~ within the [[https://github.com/rust-lang/polonius/blob/master/polonius-engine/src/facts.rs][polonius-engine]]. There are some small useful comments.

- src_rust{pub var_used_at: Vec<(T::Variable, T::Point)>}
- src_rust{pub var_defined_at: Vec<(T::Variable, T::Point)>}
- src_rust{pub var_dropped_at: Vec<(T::Variable, T::Point)>}
- src_rust{pub use_of_var_derefs_origin: Vec<(T::Variable, T::Origin)>}
- src_rust{pub drop_of_var_derefs_origin: Vec<(T::Variable, T::Origin)>}
- src_rust{pub child_path: Vec<(T::Path, T::Path)>}
- src_rust{pub path_is_var: Vec<(T::Path, T::Variable)>}
- src_rust{pub path_assigned_at_base: Vec<(T::Path, T::Point)>}
- src_rust{pub path_moved_at_base: Vec<(T::Path, T::Point)>}
- src_rust{pub path_accessed_at_base: Vec<(T::Path, T::Point)>}

**** About Retrieving Info ...
With how these facts are stored, the ~AllFacts~ data structure resembles a
mini-database (of sorts). Thus, I can construct a series of /queries/ which will
chop and combine the *relations* to get the info I need. What sorts of things are
interesting? Here are some bits of information we'll want, or questions to ponder.

- NEED: Set of live points for a MIR place.
- Q: What information do we need to explain errors?
  This topic is going to be more difficult that anticipated. The reason for this
  is Polonius information is /not enough in all cases/. This point needs to be
  explained a little further, it involves non-variant lifetimes and the MIR
  typechecker. In brief, the typechecker information isn't retrievable but the
  polonius facts are only sufficient in the easy cases.
  - [ ] TODO explain this with an example.
